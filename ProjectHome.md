This is a simple game to allow immersive experience of meme propagation in a simulated field of crude NPCs.

Currently it consists of a 2D game space with edge-wrap wherein "food" grows and numerous "NPCs" wander around eating it.  These NPCs can clone themselves through a sort of mitosis, and they can "die" by running out of food (it "costs" food to move.)

Already with this simple model we got population fluctuations as the NPCs reproduce, overeat, starve off, then grow again as the food supply recovers.

In the next phase of this system "spores" are introduced.  These spores can "infect" NPCs, causing them to change their behaviour.  All spores cause their hosts to create and transmit _copies_ of themselves to other NPCs around them, effectively attempting to infect them with the same "genus" of spore.  _(This is the memetic propagation aspect of the game.)_

The spores also affect the behaviour of their hosts, or even just NPCs they come in contact with, in another way.  When someone is sent a spore, or all the time if they're host to a spore, there is a chance that the spore causes that person to give up or "tithe" some of their own food supply to the person who sent them the spore (or, in the case of an infected NPC, to the person who originally infected them.)

This means that, in addition to wandering around and foraging, NPCs can increase their food supply by infecting others with spores that they themselves have been infected with.  Yes, they stand a chance each turn of "tithing" to their "infectors", but each of the NPCs _they_ infect will stand that same chance of "tithing" to them, so it's in their best interests to get infected by at least one spore right away and to then immediately start to try to infect others.

Currently there is just one spore "genus", but there will eventually be several (if not hundreds of) different genera each with a different effect on the NPCs' behaviours.  This means the NPCs, although identical themselves, will have different behaviour patterns depending on which spores each is infected with.

When an NPC reproduces the spore(s) it carries are copied into its offspring. This "mitosis", in combination with the possibility of death by starvation, creates a kind of evolutionary selective pressure on the mix of spore "DNA" in the population.

Combinations of spore behaviour-effects will cause variations in the food gathering and reproductive success of the NPC carriers.  Useful patterns and synergies between spores will prosper and spread, while less effective combinations will wane and eventually pass away.

**Sbonu is intended as a tool to explore those combinations via simulation.**

The game aspect of the sim comes in when you take control of one of the NPCs and dive into the world yourself to live or die, to found great dynasties or perish anonymously in the crush of the teaming masses.  Find and spread the winning combination.  Help your people to prosper and grow.  Leave hordes of children to honour your name through the generations to come!  --or die unsung and alone as the uncaring crowd rushes past you to eat the precious food sprouting from your withering corpse.

It's your choice-- your fate!  **Sbonu!**
